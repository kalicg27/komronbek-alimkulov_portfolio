# Hi, I'm Komronbek 

I am a Technical QA Engineer with a strong background in Unreal Engine, Python automation, and Houdini procedural tools.  
Previously, I worked as a 3D Generalist and Technical Artist, creating pipelines, tools, and complex systems using Unreal Engine, Houdini, and C++.  
I now apply this technical experience to software and game testing, focusing on automation, debugging, and testing workflows.

I am currently building a set of five automation engineering projects to become a top-level Technical Software Test Engineer.
