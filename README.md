# Hi, I'm Komronbek 

I am a QA Automation Engineer specialising in Python-based automation frameworks for API and UI testing. Experienced in building scalable test architectures using Pytest, Playwright, Selenium WebDriver, and BDD frameworks. Strong understanding of REST API validation, DOM interaction, advanced locators (XPath/CSS), and automated reporting. Focused on clean code, maintainable test design, and CI/CD integration.

I am currently building a set of five automation engineering projects to become a top-level QA Automation Engineer.
